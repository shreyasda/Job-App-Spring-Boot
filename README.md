# Job Application Project using Spring Boot

This project is a **Spring Boot** application implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing job applications. This is the first step towards transitioning the project from a REST API architecture to Microservices.

## Project Overview

The **Job Application Project** allows users to perform CRUD operations on job applications. The main features include:

- **Create**: Add a new job application to the system.
- **Read**: Retrieve details of a job application.
- **Update**: Modify details of an existing job application.
- **Delete**: Remove a job application from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Java-based framework for building web applications.
- **REST API**: Communication between client and server.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing job application data.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: ORM tool for database interaction.
- **Microservices**: Will be implemented in future videos as the architecture evolves.

## Requirements

- **Java 11** or higher
- **Maven** (or Gradle)
- **MySQL** Database
- **Insomnia/Postman** for API testing
- **Git**
